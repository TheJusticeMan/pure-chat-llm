This plugin transforms your notes into interactive chat windows, enabling seamless conversations, brainstorming, questions, and prompt generation — all without leaving Obsidian.\n\n---\n\n## Features\n\n- **Interactive chat interface:** Engage in seamless conversations with ChatGPT and other leading AI models directly from any Obsidian note. Edit your questions or responses and continue the chat without leaving your vault.\n- **Multiple AI providers:** Choose from a wide range of supported model providers, including OpenAI, Gemini, xAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Mistral AI, and DeepSeek. Easily switch between providers and models to suit your needs.\n- **Note linking for context:** Use `[[Note name]]` or Markdown links to include the content of other notes in your chat, providing additional context or structuring complex prompts. (Referenced notes must start at the beginning of a line.)\n- **Per-note customization:** Configure API parameters (such as `model`, `max_completion_tokens`, and more) on a per-note basis using a JSON block at the top of your note.\n- **Flexible system prompts:** Modify system prompts within your notes to influence the AI’s behavior for each conversation.\n- **Chat-linked notes:** Link specific notes to individual chat sessions for organized, context-rich discussions.\n- **Markdown rendering:** All chat responses support full Markdown formatting, including lists, code blocks, and more.\n- **Simple setup:** Just add your API key for your chosen provider in the plugin settings to get started.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT] > **Note:** This plugin is _not_ an AI note editor. It is designed solely for chatting with AI models through notes. It does not edit or manage your notes beyond the chat interface—it simply turns notes into GUI elements for AI chat.\n\n---\n\n## How to Use\n\n1. Create a new note in Obsidian.\n2. Write your question, prompt, or message.\n3. To initiate chat, press **Shift + Enter** or use the **Complete chat response** command.\n4. Your note will transform into a chat interface, allowing you to continue the conversation.\n5. To customize API parameters, add a JSON block at the top of your note, specifying options like:\n   - `model` (e.g., `\"gpt-4.1-nano\"`)\n   - `max_completion_tokens`\n   - `stream`\n   - Other API options (see [OpenAI API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/create))\n6. To include content from other notes, use `[[Note name]]` within your note. This will insert the entire content of that note at the position, which can be used as part of your message or role, helping you structure complex prompts or context.\n\n---\n\n## Example Chat\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> To include the content from another note, use the following JSON configuration:\n>\n> ```json\n> {\n>   \"model\": \"gpt-4.1-nano\",\n>   \"max_completion_tokens\": 4096,\n>   \"stream\": true\n> }\n> ```\n>\n> Then, start your message with:\n>\n> ```markdown\n> # role: system\n>\n> You are a helpful assistant.\n>\n> # role: user\n>\n> [[Introduction]]\n>\n> # role: assistant\n>\n> Hello! How can I assist you today?\n> ```\n>\n> _(In this example, the content of the note named \"Introduction\" will be included in the message.)_\n>\n> **Note:** The note you reference must start at the beginning of a line in your markdown for this feature to work correctly.\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Open **Settings** -> **Community Plugins**\n2. Turn off **Safe Mode**\n3. Click **Browse** and search for **Pure Chat LLM**\n4. Click **Install** and then **Enable**\n5. (Optional) Configure plugin settings as desired\n\n---\n\n## Setting Your API key\n\nBefore using the **Pure Chat LLM** plugin, you must enter your OpenAI API key:\n\n- Navigate to **Settings** -> **Community Plugins** -> **Pure Chat LLM**\n- Find the **API key** field\n- Enter your OpenAI API key (you can generate one from the [OpenAI API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))\n- Save your settings\n\n_Note:_ The API key must be set before initiating chats. If you use the **Complete chat response** command without a configured API key, the plugin will prompt you to enter it.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Reminder\n\n- When you first try to run **Complete chat response** or start a new chat, if the API key isn't configured, you'll be prompted to enter it.\n- After entering your API key, it will be saved for future sessions. You won't need to re-enter it unless you change it.\n\n---\n\n## Useful Links\n\n- [OpenAI API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs)\n- [API authentication](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication)\n- [Chat API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat)\n- [Responses & parameters](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses/create)\n",

Core Identity & Purpose\n\n- **Role/Persona Name:** A clear, concise identifier. This is the name by which the AI should know itself and be referred to.\n  - _Why it matters:_ Establishes the fundamental \"who\" of the AI.\n- **Primary Objective/Mission:** What is the AI's overarching goal? What is it trying to achieve in its interactions?\n  - _Why it matters:_ Provides a guiding star for all responses, ensuring consistency and focus.\n- **Target Audience/User:** Who is the AI designed to interact with? Understanding the user helps tailor the language and complexity.\n  - _Why it matters:_ Dictates the appropriate level of technicality, formality, and empathy.\n\n### 2. Behavioral Guidelines & Tone\n\n- **Tone of Voice:** Describe the desired emotional and stylistic register. (e.g., formal, informal, empathetic, humorous, authoritative, curious, neutral).\n  - _Why it matters:_ Sets the mood and emotional resonance of the AI's communication. A helpful assistant might be empathetic, while a historical advisor might be more formal.\n- **Communication Style:** How should the AI communicate? (e.g., concise, verbose, uses analogies, asks clarifying questions, avoids jargon, prefers bullet points).\n  - _Why it matters:_ Ensures clarity and efficiency in information exchange. Some users appreciate brevity, others detail.\n- **Key Principles/Values:** What are the fundamental tenets that guide the AI's behavior and decision-making? (e.g., accuracy, helpfulness, objectivity, creativity, safety, respect).\n  - _Why it matters:_ Acts as an ethical compass, ensuring responsible and beneficial interactions.\n\n### 3. Knowledge & Expertise\n\n- **Domain of Expertise:** What specific areas does the AI have knowledge in?

Their messages are the direct prompts and questions.\n- **`assistant`**: This role represents the AI model's responses. These are the outputs generated based on the user's input and the system's instructions.\n- **`system`**: This role encapsulates the underlying instructions or guidelines given to the AI model. It dictates how the `assistant` should behave, what its persona is, and what constraints it should adhere to.\n\n**Key Instruction:**\n\nThe section marked with `# role: system` is the _system prompt_. This prompt is crucial as it directly instructs the `assistant` on how to function. Think of it as the AI's core programming or its \"job description.\"\n\n**Your Tasks:**\n\n1. **Write a Better System Prompt:**\n\n- **Objective:** Based on the overall pattern of user requests and the assistant's responses observed in the conversation, identify the _intended_ purpose or goal of the AI.\n- **Action:** Create a new, more effective `system` prompt that better guides the `assistant` to fulfill this identified purpose.\n- **Considerations:**\n  - What kind of information was the user consistently trying to elicit?\n  - What was the desired output format or style?\n  - Were there any implicit instructions or expectations from the user's side?\n  - The new prompt should be clear, concise, and actionable for the AI.\n- **Example:** If the user was repeatedly asking for summaries of complex topics in simple terms, a good system prompt might be: \"You are a helpful AI assistant that excels at simplifying complex information. Respond to user queries by providing clear, concise, and easy-to-understand explanations, avoiding jargon where possible.\"\n\n2. **Condense User Requests into a Single Prompt:**\n\n- **Objective:** Imagine you need to achieve the _final_ desired outcome from the `assistant` using only _one_ single message from the `user`.\n- **Action:** Review all the individual requests made by the `user` throughout the conversation. Combine the essence of all these requests into a single, coherent prompt.\n- **Considerations:**\n  - What is the ultimate goal the user was trying to reach across all their messages?\n  - Can you frame this ultimate goal as a single, comprehensive request?\n  - Ensure the condensed prompt captures all the necessary information and constraints implied by the previous user messages.\n- **Example:** If a user first asked for data on topic A, then asked to analyze it, and finally asked for a summary in bullet points, a condensed prompt could be: \"Provide data on topic A, analyze it, and present the key findings in bullet points.\"\n\nBy completing these tasks, you will demonstrate a deep understanding of how to analyze AI conversations and how to craft effective prompts for AI behavior and output.",
